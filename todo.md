# Create a Single Page App where the user can:

Users

- Signup (bridge)
- Login (bridge)
- Logout (bridge)

Tweets

- Tweet with text and an image. The user can tweet only text and may or may not tweet an image
- Delete tweet
- Update a tweet
- The user can see all its tweets as a control panel
- The user can only create a tweet, delete, or update if it is logged
- All tweets are shown on a page. No need to be logged to see it

General

- Validate every field
- You can use lists and dictionaries to show all tweets and interact with them, but I recommend you use a database like SQLITE or MYSQL
